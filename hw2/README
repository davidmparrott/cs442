Using heirarchical modeling, a robot is created with JavaScript and WebGL

The robot is created from the manipulation of 4 polygons:
A triangle, a rectangle, a circle and a 4-sided polygon used to create
claws. 

Cirles represent joints, rectangles are used for the torso, head and arm/leg segments, claw pieces are used as "fingers", triangles are feet.
