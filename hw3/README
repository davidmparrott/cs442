description:
A toroidal spiral is generated with dimensions that can be manipulated by
changing the values declared in torus.js on lines 43-49 and somewhat by changing torus.N and torus.M in torus.html lines 175 and 176. 

The function createGeometry is called by torus.html which populates the array
with appropriate vertex information.
